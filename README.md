Hey, how are you friend?
I already have a github account but I had to use this one to seperate my online idenity from my real one for reasons you will understand.
I don't like the life that I lead, it is full of pain and suffering. I don't like sounding arrogant or overconfident but I genuinly beleive that I have the power to change the world.
My parents are abusive, I have no self esteem and no people to support me. 
I rarely ever get to leave the house either.
I decided to take my A-levels and use university as a getaway from my parents and family.
Think of this as a documented adventure of a sixteen year old boy aspiring to leave his old life, finish A-levels, go to college, and disappear forever. Let's see how long I can stay commited to this.
Without further ado, welcome to the jungle
